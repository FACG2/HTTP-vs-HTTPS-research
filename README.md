# HTTP vs HTTPS research

> **HTTPS** (**H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol **S**ecure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. The details of the certificate, including the issuing authority and the corporate name of the website owner, can be viewed by clicking on the lock symbol on the browser bar.

### How does HTTPS work?
When you request a HTTPS connection to a webpage, the website will initially send its SSL certificate to your browser. This certificate contains the public key needed to begin the secure session. Based on this initial exchange, your browser and the website then initiate the 'SSL handshake'. The SSL handshake involves the generation of shared secrets to establish a uniquely secure connection between yourself and the website.

When a trusted SSL Digital Certificate is used during a HTTPS connection, users will see a padlock icon in the browser address bar. When an Extended Validation Certificate is installed on a web site, the address bar will turn green.

### Benefits of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
#### the major benefits of a HTTPS certificate are:
* Customer information, like credit card numbers, is encrypted and cannot be intercepted
* Visitors can verify you are a registered business and that you own the domain
* Customers are more likely to trust and complete purchases from sites that use HTTPS
